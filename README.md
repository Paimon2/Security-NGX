**DO NOT USE THIS IN ANY PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!**
Security NGX was written by a younger and much dumber me. It is not only mostly **incomplete and buggy**, but also has some **serious security vulnerabilities** which allow easy
access for virtually anyone to do all kinds of attacks. Thanks to this, the authentication system is also rendered mostly useless for any good programmer.

I will leave this up here for the sole purpose of horrible memories, to remind me in the future how bad I once was at programming - and also for others to make fun of me.
